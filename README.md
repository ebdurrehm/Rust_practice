I am learning Rust by practicing the examples which described in the main documentation.

## First lesson

What I learned:

- variable, let, mut, const
- some basic functions of the standart library (io, read_line, cmp etc.)
- shadowing variables
- shadowing vs mut
- const vs mut
- match to handle errors
- loop
- break, continue
